# Business Cases
As part of the [SAS.com](https://sas.com) Hackathon, our Team completed 6 business cases. 

## Business Case 1
Falling Materials are one of the major causes for: Workplace Fatalities. Such incidents are recorded through a mobile app for reporting incidents and identify risks. Such Delays due to incidents will help Contracts understand Productivity Losses.

## Business Case 2
Risks at Construction sites is minimized, due to the Usage of Mobile Devices in Site(s). Health & Safety considers: Mobile Phone usage as one of major causes for distraction, grabbing attention of people leading to problems in 7%, and also affecting Shift or WFH in 34% of adults.
