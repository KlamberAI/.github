# Office of National Statistics (ONS) Productivity
A problem of Productivity arose in **Digital Government Hackathon**, **WSIS Forum 2023**. The Productivity in the Marketplace, was investigated with a Construction Foundation Progress Monitoring idea called **KlinterAI**. 

### Origination of the Name of the Idea, KlinterAI
Klinter is originated from "Clinker" meaning the residue obtained from the manufacturing process of concrete. Clinker is in the form of globules as shown below:

## Productivity in using Computer Vision

### Demonstration of the Feasibility of Vision-related Processes
I made an email experimentation through my available contacts: and found several of my participants, originate from University, Organisation and Government with an overall Engagement Rate showing: **10%**. 

The **Vision-related** processes I took for a Feasibility Analysis by prioritizing them individually and then combining by a weighted-sum resulted in:
- A Great Signal in found impacting the Labour Domain due to Vision-related Processes, as usually observed
- While focusing majorly on the **Remaining Costs** saved due to **Vision-related** Processes and **Material** Costs

The **Vision-related** processes involved:
- Prioritizing the **Logistics** Domain of the Purchase-Order Expenditure by: **42%**
- Then obtaining the most signal on the **Transport** Domain

#### The Expenditure on `Purchase-Orders` Data
The below graph shows a percentage contribution of each domain within a Purchase-Order Database or Data.

#### The Statistic Obtained When `Optimizing the Throughput` to Vision-related Processes
Upon focusing on: the **Logistics** and **Transport** by making sure we balance the **Vision-related** processes appropriately, we get the below outputs on:

1. **Purchase-Orders** Domain, and 
2. The **Computer-Vision** Applications Domain

#### The Costs-Saved on the Labour side compared to the other Processes
The prioritization on the **Labour-side** observed as 3.6, when compared to other Processes which are found to be approx. 0.62 each.

#### The Fractions of Expenditure Taken for these Vision-related Processes
The Labour costs (taken as **40%**) involved in **Operationalizing** anything regarding Construction Activities with reference to Trade-codes.

### More Trivia

#### The Term `Clinker `
**Clinker**, even though it is related to: **KlinterAI** - it could also be connected with Climate or Environment-related processes. KlinterAI has a climate domain, which has been put forward to some of the competitions it has applied for. 

#### A residue in Concrete Manufacturing: about 3% contribution in Climate and Carbon emissions
