<p>A problem of Productivity arose in <strong>Digital Government Hackathon</strong>, <strong>WSIS Forum 2023</strong>. The Productivity in the Marketplace, was investigated with a Construction Foundation Progress Monitoring idea called <strong>KlinterAI</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="origination-of-the-name-of-the-idea-klinterai">Origination of the Name of the Idea, KlinterAI</h3>
<p>Klinter is originated from “Clinker” meaning the residue obtained from the manufacturing process of concrete. Clinker is in the form of globules as shown below:</p>

<h3 id="demonstration-of-the-feasibility-of-vision-related-processes">Demonstration of the Feasibility of Vision-related Processes</h3>
<p>I made an email experimentation through my available contacts: and found several of my participants, originate from University, Organisation and Government with an overall Engagement Rate showing: <strong>10%</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Vision-related</strong> processes I took for a Feasibility Analysis by prioritizing them individually and then combining by a weighted-sum resulted in:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Great Signal in found impacting the Labour Domain due to Vision-related Processes, as usually observed</li>
<li>While focusing majorly on the <strong>Remaining Costs</strong> saved due to <strong>Vision-related</strong> Processes and <strong>Material</strong> Costs</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Vision-related</strong> processes involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritizing the <strong>Logistics</strong> Domain of the Purchase-Order Expenditure by: <strong>42%</strong></li>
<li>Then obtaining the most signal on the <strong>Transport</strong> Domain</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-expenditure-on-purchase-orders-data">The Expenditure on <code>Purchase-Orders</code> Data</h4>
<p>The below graph shows a percentage contribution of each domain within a Purchase-Order Database or Data.</p>

<p>Upon focusing on: the <strong>Logistics</strong> and <strong>Transport</strong> by making sure we balance the <strong>Vision-related</strong> processes appropriately, we get the below outputs on:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Purchase-Orders</strong> Domain, and</li>
<li>The <strong>Computer-Vision</strong> Applications Domain</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="the-costs-saved-on-the-labour-side-compared-to-the-other-processes">The Costs-Saved on the Labour side compared to the other Processes</h4>
<p>The prioritization on the <strong>Labour-side</strong> observed as 3.6, when compared to other Processes which are found to be approx. 0.62 each.</p>

<h4 id="the-term-clinker">The Term <code>Clinker</code></h4>
<p><strong>Clinker</strong>, even though it is related to: <strong>KlinterAI</strong> - it could also be connected with Climate or Environment-related processes. KlinterAI has a climate domain, which has been put forward to some of the competitions it has applied for.</p>
